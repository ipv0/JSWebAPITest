# JSWebAPITest
<h6><i>Educational project. Work in progress.</i><h6><br /> 
===================
Re-learning JS, writing a simple app to pull data from APIs. <br />
Eventually it'll be a zero click tool for aspiring HNT miners to quickly see how other miners around them are doing. <br />
Once that's done I might redo it in React.
